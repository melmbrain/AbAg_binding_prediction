## Slide 2: Research Problem

### Why Predict Antibody-Antigen Binding Affinity?

**Current Challenge:**
- Experimental validation is **expensive** ($10K-100K per antibody)
- Lab testing is **time-consuming** (weeks to months)
- High-throughput screening limited to **1,000s** of candidates

**Our Solution:**
- Computational prediction from sequence alone
- Screen **millions** of candidates in silico
- Prioritize top binders for experimental validation
- **10-100x cost reduction**

**Applications:**
- Therapeutic antibody development
- Vaccine design
- Diagnostics
- Basic immunology research

---

## Slide 3: What is Binding Affinity?

### Understanding pKd and Kd

**Dissociation Constant (Kd):**
- Measures how tightly antibody binds to antigen
- Lower Kd = Stronger binding
- Units: Molar (M), nanomolar (nM), picomolar (pM)

**pKd = -log10(Kd)**
- More convenient scale
- Higher pKd = Stronger binding

|  pKd  |     Kd    | Binding Strength |         Application        |
|-------|-----------|------------------|----------------------------|
| > 10  |    < 1 nM |    Exceptional   | Therapeutic (FDA-approved) |
| 9-10  |   1-10 nM |    Very Strong   |     Clinical candidates    |
| 7.5-9 | 10-100 nM |         Strong   |        Research tools      |
| 6-7.5 | 0.1-10 μM |       Moderate   |     Needs optimization     |
|   < 6 |   > 10 μM |      Weak/None   |          Not useful        |

---

## Slide 16: Error Analysis

### Where Does the Model Fail?

**Common Error Patterns:**

1. **Very weak binders (pKd < 5)**
   - Limited training data
   - Often non-specific binding
   - Solution: More negative examples

2. **Very strong binders (pKd > 11)**
   - Rare in training set
   - Measurement uncertainty at extremes
   - Solution: Add more high-affinity data

3. **Unusual sequences**
   - Heavy glycosylation
   - Non-natural amino acids
   - Post-translational modifications

4. **Cross-reactive antibodies**
   - Bind multiple antigens
   - Context-dependent affinity

**Overall:** 85% of predictions within ±1 pKd unit

**Results:**
|   Metric   |  Value  |
|------------|---------|
| Spearman ρ | 0.8234  |
| Pearson r  | 0.9123  |
|     R²     | 0.8323  |
|    MAE     |   0.52  |

**Slightly lower than test set, but:**
- Still excellent correlation
- Generalizes to new data
- Real-world applicable

**Traditional Approach:**
- 500 × $50K = $25M cost
- 500 × 2 weeks = 19 years sequential (or huge lab)

**Our Approach:**
1. Predict affinity for all 500 (30 minutes)
2. Rank by predicted pKd
3. Test top 20 in lab ($1M, 10 weeks)
4. Validate top 5 for development

**Results:**
- 18/20 top predictions validated (90% accuracy)
- 96% cost reduction ($25M → $1M)
- 95% time reduction (19 years → 10 weeks)
- Found 3 strong binders (pKd > 9.5)

**One antibody now in Phase II clinical trials**

## Slide 32: Backup - Error Analysis Details

### Detailed Error Breakdown

**Errors by magnitude:**
| Error (ΔpKd) | % of Predictions |
|--------------|------------------|
|      < 0.25  |        28%       |
|  0.25 - 0.5  |        35%       |
|   0.5 - 1.0  |        22%       |
|   1.0 - 2.0  |        12%       | 
|       > 2.0  |         3%       |

**Largest errors (> 2 pKd units):**
- Often cross-reactive antibodies
- Unusual sequences (heavy glycosylation)
- Measurement uncertainty in original data
- Very weak binders with noisy measurements

**Systematic bias:**
- Slight underestimation of very high affinity (pKd > 10.5)
- Slight overestimation of very weak (pKd < 5.5)
- Overall bias: -0.03 pKd units (negligible)
