AFFINITY DISTRIBUTION:
  Very weak  (<5):     7,246 ( 1.85%)
  Weak      (5-7):   133,314 (34.12%)
  Moderate  (7-9):   124,594 (31.89%)
  Strong    (9-11):  116,223 (29.74%)
  Very strong (>11):     384 ( 0.10%)  <-- IMPROVED!

DATA SOURCES:
  - Original Phase 6 dataset: 204,986 samples
  - AbBiBench: 185,718 samples
  - SAAINT-DB therapeutics: 53 samples

================================================================================
                           EXPECTED MODEL IMPROVEMENTS
================================================================================

VERY STRONG BINDER PREDICTIONS:
  Current RMSE (estimated): ~2.2
  After training (estimated): ~1.8
  Expected improvement: ~18%

  Total improvement from Phase 6: ~28% (from RMSE ~2.5)

WHY THIS MATTERS:
  - Better therapeutic antibody design
  - Improved screening for picomolar binders
  - Model learns from FDA-approved antibodies
  - Can predict mutations for ultra-high affinity

                                NEXT STEPS
================================================================================

IMMEDIATE (DO NOW):

  1. Generate ESM2 Embeddings for New Entries
     - 53 new therapeutic antibodies need embeddings
     - Extract sequences from merged_with_therapeutics.csv
     - Apply existing PCA transformation (150 components)

  2. Train Model with Enhanced Dataset
     python train_balanced.py \
       --data external_data/merged_with_therapeutics.csv \
       --loss weighted_mse \
       --sampling stratified \
       --epochs 100

  3. Evaluate Very Strong Bin Performance
     - Track per-bin RMSE during training
     - Compare with baseline (before therapeutic integration)
     - Measure improvement on picomolar predictions

THIS WEEK:

  4. Consider Additional Therapeutic Sources
     - Ab-CoV: 568 Kd measurements (manual download)
     - Thera-SAbDab: 461 therapeutics (manual download)
     - Expected: +100-200 more very strong binders

  5. Cross-Validation on Therapeutics
     - Hold out therapeutic antibodies as test set
     - Evaluate therapeutic antibody prediction accuracy
